# Include Directory Structure

This directory contains all project header files, organized by responsibility:

## Directory Organization

### config/
System-wide configuration constants and settings
- `Config.h` - WiFi credentials, server settings, hardware pins, thresholds

### hardware/
Hardware abstraction and device drivers
- `ITemperatureSensor.h` - Temperature sensor interface
- `HeatingElement.h` - Heating element controller with safety features

### managers/
High-level business logic and system management
- `HeaterModeManager.h` - Operating mode management (OFF, RAMP, HOLD, TIMER)
- `NotepadManager.h` - Experiment notes persistence
- `StateManager.h` - Global system state management
- `WebServerManager.h` - Web server and WebSocket handling

### utilities/
Helper utilities and support functionality
- `FileSystemExplorer.h` - LittleFS file system web interface
- `SerialRemote.h` - TCP-based remote serial logging
- `WebServerActions.h` - WebSocket message handlers

## Include Conventions

Headers in subdirectories should be included with their relative path:
```cpp
#include "config/Config.h"
#include "hardware/HeatingElement.h"
#include "managers/WebServerManager.h"
#include "utilities/SerialRemote.h"
```

Libraries in the `lib/` directory use angle brackets:
```cpp
#include <MAX31865Adapter.h>
```

This structure follows PlatformIO best practices for maintainability and scalability.
